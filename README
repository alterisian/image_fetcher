ImageFetcher
=-=-=-=-=-=-
Author: Ian Moss - @alterisian

This is an image fetcher utlity invoked from the command line.

0. Usage: (from the root of application directory)
ruby ./runner.rb "./input/image_list.txt"

Parameter is a file with list of image urls, one per line.

1. Dependency: Ruby 2.7.1
A ruby version manager such as RVM or Rbenv would be useful. 

rvm use 2.7.1
rvm gemset create getsafe
rvm gemset use getsafe

2. Gems install via: 
bundle install

(If bundler not installed, then before: 
gem install bundler)

Uses the gem Down for robust filedownloading

3. Test with rspec, run with:
rspec 
or for more verbose output:
rspec --format documentation

==================================================================
Bugs:

1 - Rspec is not picking up a raised exception with a message.
  - replicate: rspec ./spec/image_fetcher_spec.rb:57

Extensions:

1 - We could have a custom application exception to capture and rethrow exceptions in a controlled manner.
2 - We should probably version the downloads, and we could do this by having a subdirectory, with an incrementing number. This would easily allow the script to be run multiple times.
3 - We could redirect the STDOUT to a log file under the application directory
4 - We should continue where filenames are broken, or files are unreachable generally. 
5 - We should save the path as part of the filename to avoid simple duplications
6 - We should ignore same path / same files, if already downloaded.
7 - We should create the ImageFetcher instance, and call go, in a seperate runner file
8 - We should impose a maximum image size in Down, based on known expected file sizes.

Challenge Backend Ruby (m/f/d) for Get Safe

Specification: Image Fetcher

To learn more about the way you develop, we have a remote assessment:

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a program with a simple command line interface that takes this plaintext file as an
argument and downloads all images, storing them on the local hard disk.

Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal day's work: 

as if this code will be used in important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on. 
Please specifically consider:
- Separation of Concerns
- Testing
- Error handling

Please use Ruby for your solution. We prefer to receive your code in GitHub.

Above all: have fun
